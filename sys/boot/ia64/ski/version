NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.  The format of this
file is important.  Make sure the current version number is on line 6.

1.2:    Restructured. Has some user visible differences. Due to code
	sharing, has been given the same version number as the EFI
	loader.
0.2:	Pass the address of the bootinfo block to the kernel in register
	r8. Keep it at the hardwired address for now.
0.1:	Initial SKI version.
